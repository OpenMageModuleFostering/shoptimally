This is the "Core" Shoptimally module, which does three things:

- Inject the client javascript into the site (note: uses templates and layout files).
- Add general Shoptimally settings into the admin panel (API key, enable/disable, etc.)
- Provide general helpers with basic functionality that is relevant to all future modules.

Note: all other modules rely on the existence of this module to work.
